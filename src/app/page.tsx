        I&#8217;m a frontend developer, optimist, and community enthusiast. I
        currently work as developer at the startup <span>Connou</span>, where I
        help build an education platform for Universities, using Typescript and
        Nextj.s

        I help building reusable components and refactoring for cleaner and
        maintainable code. Currently, I&#8217;m migrating styled components to
        TailwindCSS, one component at a time. I work independently and Iâ€™m happy
        to collaborate with designers and other developers.

        I recently started writing content on my blog as a way to become better
        a communicator. You will find articles about technologies Iâ€™m interested
        in at the time, or how I&#8217;m learning and growing in my career,
        sharing knowledge along the way.

        While using the latest framework, I still spend time learning and
        practising the fundamentals of Javascript and CSS, I have a dedicated
        lab section for it.
