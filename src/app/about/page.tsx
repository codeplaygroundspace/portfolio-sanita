        <p>Passionate Coder, Creative Problem Solver, and Team Player.</p>

        <h2 className="font-medium text-xl mb-1">As a developer</h2>
        <p>
          I pay close attention to my code&apos;s readability. I aim for clean,
          consistent, readable and maintainable code. It&apos;s great when
          features work, but it&apos;s even greater whenever they can stay that
          way, regardless of who&apos;s working on them. I&apos;m excited to
          work on new projects, because I learn something new every time.
          I&apos;m always excited for the next challenge!
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-medium text-xl mb-1">As a person</h2>
        <p>
          If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be resourceful.
          I&apos;ll take a problem, break it into smaller bits and MacGyver
          myself a solution. Creativity has helped me sail around tough
          obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am curious by nature and I love learning. I&apos;ve amassed a wide
          range of skills and interests that when put together, end up feeding
          my career in one way or another.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-medium text-xl mb-1">As a colleague</h2>
        <p>
          I am a team player, with my background in business and law, I feel
          comfortable interacting with both the technically oriented people of
          the team as well as stakeholders. I will always go the extra mile to
          help my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience working for a small startup gave me exposure to the
          business side of a tech company, while at the same time delivering
          industry standard results on the production side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always happy to pull an espresso shot and make some latte art for
          a colleague. I love to cook, so be on the lookout for the next
          potluck.
        </p>
        <p>Let&apos;s have a chat! I&apos;d love to hear from you.</p>
